          Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Cameron Reynolds. I am an
          up and coming software developer looking to develop my career and put
          my skills to use for creating something meaningful. I am a recent
          graduate of North Carolina State University, where I studied computer
          science and sport management. During my time at NC State, I enjoyed
          learning about computer science from one of the best schools in the
          country to offer the program. Go Pack!

      <h2>More About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I will use this section to tell you a little more about me - including
        my background, education, and qualifications. I am from Columbia, North
        Carolina, a small town inland from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. I
        went to a small high school consisting of about 140 people total, where
        I graduated as a Salutatorian and received a full-ride scholarship to
        North Carolina State University. Growing up in a coastal town, I worked
        on a crab boat during the summers where I made my spending money.
        Throughout high school, I enjoyed playing baseball and basketball, while
        spending my other free time fishing and doing water sports. I recently
        took on playing a lot of golf and snowboarding whenever I get the
        chance!
      </p>
      <p>
        As an undergraduate at North Carolina State University, I took many
        computer science classes that laid the basis for where I am today. At NC
        State I would learn various languages: Java, C, C++, and a little HTML.
        I learned the fundamentals of programming and the process of the
        software development life cycle. Here I gained in-depth knowledge about
        object oriented programming, data structures, operating systems, and
        distributed systems. Using this knowledge, I applied it to real world
        projects through our coursework. Below are some of the classes that I
        took at NC State.
      </p>
      <ul class="classes">
        <li>CSC116: Introduction to Computing - Java</li>
        <li>CSC216: Programming Concepts - Java</li>
        <li>CSC226: Discrete Mathematics</li>
        <li>CSC230: C/Software Tools - C/C++</li>
        <li>CSC236: Operating Systems - C/Java</li>
        <li>CSC316: Data Structures - Java</li>

          <p class="project-details">
            Pack Scheduler was one of my favorite projects that I completed in
            my time at NC State because I was able to make sense of something I
            had to do every semester and know what was actually going on behind
            the scenes! This project mocks the process of registering for
            classes that all NC State students do with each new semester. Our
            version of this course registration system provides users with all
            of the functionality that the normal system used by NC State
            provides. The program has dashboards for users dependent on their
            role: student, teacher, or registrar. Each role has different
            functionalities and views for these users. Overall, this project
            taught me many of the principles of Object Oriented Programing. This
            program demonstrates the use of object oriented programming with
            abstraction, while also using encryption, data structures, and IO.

          <p class="project-details">
            One of my most important projects yet, creating my portfolio website
            taught me a lot about some new languages I had not yet dabbled in,
            while also teaching me some important lessons about life. During the
            course of this project's creation I worked two jobs, devoting as
            much of my free time to watching YouTube videos and practing my newly
            learned skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the creation
            of the website, my commitment to complete this website reinforced
            the values I was taught as a child. Nothing in life comes without
            sacrifice - if you want to accomplish something, you have to put
            forward the time and effort.
